## Introduction ##

This software was developed in the context of the [2011 EWH Competition](http://ewh.org/index.php/programs/technology/competition/).
The project name is:
Blood Pressure (BP) Assist Device

This project will develop a low cost, easy-to-use device to assist a minimally-trained person in taking the BP using a cuff, a cell-phone and small signal acquisition box that connects both.
The main ideas are the replacement of the high-cost manometer of the sphygmomanometer,
which can be done using a small, low-cost, signal acquisition box attached to the manometer tube in order to get pressure signal; eliminate the need to be trained (only picture instructions) to identify Korotkoff sounds by connecting the signal acquisition box to a cell phone that would process and display the blood pressure result.

The hardware needed to make this software work is:
Android Device with USB-OTG + USB-OTG Adapter (device specific) + BP Box + Blood pressure Cuff with manual Pump and Valve.

The main features of the software are:

1) Measure Systolic, Diastolic pressure and pulse, from cuff with manual pump.

2) Save blood pressure and pulse measure into device database.

3) View saved blood pressure and pulse measures.

4) Integration with the MIT Sana Framework
