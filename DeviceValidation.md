PRE-VALIDATION OF THE PROTOTYPE

Table of contents



# Methodology #

The prototype was used in 5 different healthy volunteers (1 female, mean age 25.0, range 24-27 years, 1 Hispanic, 3 Caucasian and 1 Afro-European) to measure the systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR). The automatic [Boots Arm Cuff BP Monitor](http://www.boots.com/en/Boots-Upper-Arm-Blood-Pressure-Monitor_1014526/) (Product Reference: 5690447, The Boots Company PLC, Nottingham, England), which is well known and received CE Mark approval, was used in order to validate the BP and HR measurements.
Three measurements with both devices were taken for each subject in the following conditions:
> Test 1: after lying down for 5 minutes <br>
<blockquote>Test 2: after running for 5 minutes <br>
Test 3: after inserting the right hand in a bucket of ice water for 1 minute <br></blockquote>

The measurements were performed on the left arm with the subject sitting down with the cuff at the same height as the heart, except for the first condition where the subject remained lied down. A 5-minute period was given between the readings from the two devices.<br>
<br>
<h1>Results</h1>

The mean percentage change values (mean ± SD) were compared: <br>

<blockquote>A) for each individual over all three types of tests <br>
B) for all individuals for each type of test <br>
C) for all individuals over all readings <br></blockquote>

The results are shown below. Tables show the mean percentage change values (mean ± SD) in %.<br>

<h1>Discussion</h1>

The preliminary data showed a good agreement between the values measured with both devices, with an average error of less than 20%, which is within the accuracy levels of the Boots device itself.
